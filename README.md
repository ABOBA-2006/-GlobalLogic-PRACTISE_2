Simple project that can read user string input and print some ASCII symbols

Main features:
 - Cool UI
 - User input validation:
   * empty string
   * too long input
 - Restart the program

Hope you have a great experience using my program! ❤️

P.S. On Linux, when using a UTF-8 terminal, only the basic ASCII table will display. On Windows, the full extended table works fine.
